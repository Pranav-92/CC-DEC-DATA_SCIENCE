 In this project, I have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using python.

Task Name: Fake News Detection

IDE: Jupyter NoteBook

STEPS:-
1) I took the dataset from Kaggle.com(Dataset in given in the repo in zip as well as csv formant)
2) Then I imported the required library 
3) Imported the Dataset
4) Done some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) 
5) Visualization of the dataset(about the ration of true and false news)
6) Data Cleaning (Removing the most commonly used words and )
7) Visualization of the most the news is about 
8) Finding out the accuracy of the model
